# CRYPTO SQUARE GENERATOR

_A simple program that outputs the encoded version of a given block of text_.<br/>
_version: 16/05/2019_<br/>

_By **Josh Hortt**_

## Goal

_Branching, Arrays & Looping Practice: using the .forEach, .submit(), .charAt(), .text(), .join()_,<br/>
_.val(), .push(), the .length property and RegExp object constructor_<br/>
_and many more methods/functions using jQuery / JavaScript_.

## About

_**Crypto Square** is a classic method for composing secret messages_.<br/>
_The spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the characters are written_<br/>
_into a square (or rectangle) and the entire message is down-cased_.<br/>
_For example, the sentence "don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to the person you were yesterday"_<br/>
_is 69 characters long, so it is written into a rectangle with 9 rows and 8 columns_.<br/>
_The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right, outputting encoded text in_<br/>
_groups of five letters. For example, the message above is coded as_:<br/>
_**daeer leweo rlref rerne fsyts rdtyt coooe acooo utnyy ouomr hyemr tpseo spsha eput**_

## Specifications Outline:

_1. Identify each individual behavior this application should demonstrate, and write a specification_<br/>
_(including an input/output example) for each_.<br/>
_2. Tackle writing code for one behavior at a time, and ensure your 'specs' receives the correct output when you_<br/>
_provide your input example before moving to the next specification_<br/>
_3. The size of the square (number of columns) should be decided by the length of the message_.<br/>
_4. If the message is a length that creates a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc), use that number of columns_.<br/>
_5. If the message doesn't fit neatly into a square, choose the number of columns that corresponds to the smallest square_<br/>
_that is larger than the number of characters in the message_.
